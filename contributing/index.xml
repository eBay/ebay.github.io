The following steps are required when creating your outbound project and before submitting it for approval to eBay’s Open Source Committee (the Committee):

eBay uses a red/yellow/green designation to indicate license risk to the company. The authoritative source of truth here is snyk, which we use to ensure the policy is met. All projects licensed under non-&amp;ldquo;green&amp;rdquo; licenses must go through an approval process. If something isn&amp;rsquo;t listed here, it needs to go through the approval process.
These are eBay&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;green&amp;rdquo; licenses.</description></item><item><title>Repository Best Practices</title><link>https://opensource.ebay.com/contributing/repo-best-practices/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://opensource.ebay.com/contributing/repo-best-practices/</guid><description>To ensure that we adhere to general community expectations, there are some common requirements we have within eBay&amp;rsquo;s open source code.
README You MUST to have a README file. It should cover what the project is, why someone might want to use it, and general instructions on how to use the thing. You may also want to include badges at the top, like your travis-ci build status, code coverage, etc.</description></item></channel></rss>
