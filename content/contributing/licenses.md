title: Licenses

Absent other compelling reasons, eBay releases software under the Apache 2.0 license.

eBay uses a red/yellow/green designation to indicate license risk to the company. The authoritative source of truth here is snyk, which we use to ensure the policy is met. All projects licensed under non-"green" licenses must go through an approval process.

These are eBay's "green" licenses. This means that you can use these licenses without approval from the OSPO.
- MIT
- Apache 2.0
- BSD-2
- Creative Commons
- PSF (Python Software Foundation)
- Unlicense

These licenses are considered on a case-by-case basis (significant review, audit, and benefit-to-risk assessment) and are considered "yellow":
- LGPL
- MPL 2.0
- EPL

Projects associated with the following licenses are not likely to be approved by the Committee, e.g. "red":
- GPL
- AGPL
- SSPL
- MPL
