Outbound projects/repositories are developed internally at eBay and released publicly to the open-source community on eBay’s public open source site ([github.com/ebay](https://github.com/ebay)). These repositories are governed by our [external Code of Conduct](https://github.com/eBay/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), in addition to internal eBay policies. The following steps are required when creating your outbound project and before submitting it for approval to eBay’s Open Source Committee (the Committee):

- Name Your Project/Repository: choose a descriptive and easy to remember name that clearly sets out what the project is.
- Have Your Code Reviewed: have someone review your code both for good coding practices and to remove any proprietary or confidential eBay information
- Include a README file: state what your project does in plain, easy to read language, and provide documentation where appropriate. ([example](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js#readme))
- Include a LICENSE file: eBay requires a separate license file in your top-level directory. Your license file (e.g., license.txt, license.md) must contain a verbatim copy of your approved license. eBay’s preferred license is [Apache 2.0](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0). If you need to use a different license, you must receive approval from eBay’s open source legal counsel. If the license is too long to be copied verbatim, you must include a link to the official license.

Here's a [good example repo](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js#readme).

## Maintenance expectations

We want our GitHub presence to be a vibrant playground of collaboration. We want
you to engage with the communities your project. This includes responding to
issues and pull requests, keeping your dependencies up to date for security
reasons, and more. If a repository is dormant for a long period of time, we may
archive it so users are clear on what they should expect regarding support from eBay.
